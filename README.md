## Twitter Bootstrap MVC Templates

A set of changes to style the default MVC template to use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

It also provides some scaffolding to use the same templates for new Controller Views.

### Usage

Download from [nuget](http://nuget.org/packages/MahApps.Twitter.Bootstrap) into your solution.

### Getting started

Copy the required views from Views-Bootstrap over Views, and build some new controllers, or new views from existing controllers.

Tweak as required :)

### Contributing (or, THIS IS WRONG - FIX IT!)

I take Pull Requests, please show me what you would fix and some examples and we'll upgrade the nuget package for any appropriate changes.
